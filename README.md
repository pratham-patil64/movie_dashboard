Built with modern web technologies, WatchTime offers a sleek, intuitive, and highly responsive user experience, reminiscent of popular streaming platforms.

## ‚ú® Features

WatchTime comes packed with features to enhance your entertainment journey:

* **Personalized Collection Management:**
    * Effortlessly add and manage your favorite movies and series in one centralized place.
    * Categorize content by genre, year, and type (movie/series).
    * Edit and remove entries from your collection.

* **Smart Search & Auto-Population (TMDB Integration):**
    * Streamlined content entry with real-time search powered by The Movie Database (TMDB).
    * As you type, get instant suggestions for movies and series.
    * Select a suggestion to automatically populate fields like title, poster image, release year, rating, description, and even a YouTube trailer link.

* **Netflix-Inspired Movie Details Modal:**
    * Click on any movie or series to open a professional, immersive modal displaying comprehensive details, a large poster, and quick actions.

* **Dynamic Content Sections:**
    * **Hero Section:** Features your highest-rated movie or a default cinematic experience.
    * **Top 10 Section:** Automatically showcases your top-rated movies and series, providing a quick overview of your best content.
    * **Categorized Browsing:** Content is neatly organized into scrollable rows by genre, making it easy to navigate your collection.

* **Personalized Recommendations:**
    * A dedicated "Recommendations" page that suggests new movies and series.
    * Leverages your existing collection and TMDB's "similar content" API to provide highly personalized suggestions.

    * Secure user login and registration powered by Supabase Auth.
    * Protect your personal dashboard with authenticated access.

* **Responsive Design:**
    * Seamlessly adapts to all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) for an optimal viewing and interaction experience.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run WatchTime locally.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* npm or Bun (Bun is used in `bun.lockb`, but npm/yarn should also work)
* Git
* A [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) account
* A [TMDB API Key (v3)](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>
    cd movie_dashboard # Or whatever your cloned folder is named
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    # If using npm
    npm install

    # If using Bun (recommended for speed)
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your Supabase and TMDB API keys:

    ```
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL
    VITE_SUPABASE_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
    VITE_TMDB_API_KEY=YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY
    ```

    * You can find your Supabase URL and Anon Key in your Supabase project settings under `API`.
    * Obtain your TMDB API Key from your [TMDB account settings](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api).

### Supabase Database Setup

You need to set up two tables (`movies` and `watch_requests`) and configure Row Level Security (RLS) in your Supabase project.

1.  **Go to your Supabase project dashboard.**

2.  **Navigate to `SQL Editor`** and run the following SQL queries:

    **a) `movies` table:**

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE public.movies (
        id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
        user_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id),
        title text NOT NULL,
        genre text NOT NULL,
        year integer,
        rating numeric,
        image text,
        description text,
        trailer_url text,
        type text NOT NULL,
        created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now()
    );

    ALTER TABLE public.movies ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

    CREATE POLICY "Allow read access for all users" ON public.movies FOR SELECT USING (true);
    CREATE POLICY "Allow insert for authenticated users" ON public.movies FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
    CREATE POLICY "Allow update for owner" ON public.movies FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
    CREATE POLICY "Allow delete for owner" ON public.movies FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
    ```

    **b) `watch_requests` table:**

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE public.watch_requests (
        id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
        movie_id text NOT NULL,
        movie_title text NOT NULL,
        movie_image text,
        requester_email text NOT NULL,
        scheduled_date date NOT NULL,
        owner_user_id uuid NOT NULL,
        status text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending', -- 'pending', 'accepted', 'declined'
        created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now()
    );

    ALTER TABLE public.watch_requests ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

    -- Policy for SELECT: Allow anyone to read requests (useful for owner to see them)
    CREATE POLICY "Enable read access for all users" ON public.watch_requests FOR SELECT USING (true);

    -- Policy for INSERT: Allow authenticated users AND anonymous users (for shared links) to create requests
    CREATE POLICY "Allow anon and auth to create watch requests"
    ON public.watch_requests
    FOR INSERT
    TO public, anon, authenticated
    WITH CHECK (true);

    -- Policy for UPDATE: Only the owner of the dashboard can update the request status
    CREATE POLICY "Enable update for owner_user_id" ON public.watch_requests FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = owner_user_id);
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    # If using npm
    npm run dev

    # If using Bun
    bun run dev
    ```

2.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` (or the port indicated by your terminal).

* **Add Movies/Series:** Click the "Add" button in the header. Use the search bar to find titles via TMDB, or fill in details manually.
